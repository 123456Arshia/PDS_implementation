# PDS_implementation
Manage and monitor software components and services efficiently with this C++ Package Dependency System (PDS). Ensure dependency resolution, handle errors, and perform health checks. Simplify component and service management for your projects.

# C++ Package Dependency System (PDS)

## Overview

The C++ Package Dependency System (PDS) is a versatile tool designed to facilitate the management and monitoring of software components and services within a system. It empowers developers to maintain clean and efficient software architectures by ensuring proper dependency resolution and version control.

## Key Features

- **Service and Component Classes**: The code includes well-structured classes for representing services and software components. These classes provide a foundation for organized dependency management.

- **Dependency Resolution**: PDS enforces dependency resolution, guaranteeing that components only import services that are correctly exported by other components. This safeguards against conflicts and runtime errors.

- **Error Handling**: The system incorporates custom exception classes, such as `ConflictException` and `DuplicateComponentException`, to gracefully handle potential conflicts and errors during component and service management.

- **Memory Usage Reporting**: Developers can leverage memory usage reporting functionality to monitor system resources efficiently.

- **Automated Service Updates**: PDS simplifies service version control by allowing components to be automatically updated to the latest service versions.

- **System Health Check**: It performs comprehensive health checks, verifying that all dependencies are resolved and that there are no version conflicts. This ensures system robustness.

- **Circular Dependency Detection**: PDS includes a feature to detect and prevent circular dependencies between components, promoting clean and maintainable architecture.

- **Service Notification**: Components can be notified of service updates, facilitating real-time responsiveness to changes.
