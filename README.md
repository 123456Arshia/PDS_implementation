## Introduction

Managing software components and their dependencies is a critical aspect of software engineering. The C++ Package Dependency System (PDS) is an advanced tool tailored to meet the challenges posed by intricate software architectures. PDS offers a structured approach to service and component management, ensuring that dependencies are correctly resolved, versions are controlled, and system health is maintained.

## Key Features

### Structured Service and Component Classes

PDS provides meticulously designed Service and Component classes that lay a solid foundation for the systematic representation and management of software dependencies. These classes foster a modular and maintainable system architecture.

### Dependency Resolution

PDS enforces stringent rules for dependency resolution, ensuring that components only import services that are correctly exported by other components. This mechanism minimizes conflicts and runtime errors, underpinning system reliability.

### Robust Error Handling

The system incorporates custom exception classes, such as `ConflictException` and `DuplicateComponentException`, to gracefully handle potential conflicts and errors during component and service management. This proactive error-handling approach enhances the predictability of system behavior.

### Memory Usage Reporting

PDS offers memory usage reporting capabilities, facilitating the efficient monitoring of system resources. This feature is particularly valuable for resource-sensitive software architectures.

### Automated Service Updates

The system simplifies service version control by automating updates to the latest service versions. This streamlines version management and ensures systems remain up-to-date.

### Comprehensive System Health Check

PDS conducts comprehensive health checks, validating that all dependencies are satisfactorily resolved and that version conflicts are absent. This rigorous examination ensures system robustness and reliability.

### Circular Dependency Detection

PDS includes functionality for the detection and prevention of circular dependencies between components. This proactive measure significantly enhances system maintainability and prevents architectural issues.

### Real-time Service Notification

Components can be seamlessly notified of service updates, enabling real-time responsiveness to changes. This feature is indispensable for systems requiring dynamic adaptation.
